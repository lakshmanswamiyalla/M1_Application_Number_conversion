we know, the number system is a form of expressing the numbers. In number system conversion, we will study to convert a number of one base, to a number of another base. There are a variety of number systems such as binary numbers, decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers, octal numbers, which can be exercised.
In this article, you will learn the conversion of one base number to another base number considering all the base numbers such as decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal with the help of examples. Here, the following number system conversion methods are explained.

* Binary to Decimal Number System
* Decimal to Binary Number System
* Octal to Binary Number System
* Binary to Octal Number System
* Binary to Hexadecimal Number System
* Hexadecimal to Binary Number System
The general representation of number systems are:
* Decimal Number – Base 10 – N10
* Binary Number – Base 2 – N2
* Octal Number – Base 8 – N8
* Hexadecimal Number – Base 16 – N16
# Art of work
* This is properly for education purpose.
* It completes shows list of number conversions.
* Throught experiments student can learn basics of the subject.
## 4W'S and 1H
* student can understand for what purpose they do ,why they learn,where to apply ,whom to they share knowledge,How to use

# SWOT Analysis
## STRENGTHS
* Develops knowledge
* Improves analyatical skills.
## WEAKNESS
* No hardware interface to students
## OPPORTUNITIES
* We increase no of labs
* our lab is flexible to use in windows and linux environemt.
## THREATS
* This is the basic implement it is like protype.
* High level requirements
* list of number conversion
* After completition of previous conversion then go to next conversion.
* Iow level requirements
* No need of CS,EC,EE student.
* Remember of the concepts.
