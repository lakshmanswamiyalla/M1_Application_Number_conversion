# M1_Application_Number_conversion
we know, the number system is a form of expressing the numbers. In number system conversion, we will study to convert a number of one base, to a number of another base. There are a variety of number systems such as binary numbers, decimal numbers, hexadecimal numbers, octal numbers, which can be exercised.
In this article, you will learn the conversion of one base number to another base number considering all the base numbers such as decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal with the help of examples. Here, the following number system conversion methods are explained.

* Binary to Decimal Number System
* Decimal to Binary Number System
* Octal to Binary Number System
* Binary to Octal Number System
* Binary to Hexadecimal Number System
* Hexadecimal to Binary Number System
The general representation of number systems are:
* Decimal Number – Base 10 – N10
* Binary Number – Base 2 – N2
* Octal Number – Base 8 – N8
* Hexadecimal Number – Base 16 – N16
## Aim of the project
To perform number conversion in digital electronics.
## Overview
* The project deals with the interfacing of NUMBER CONVERSIONS.
* Firstly student need to enter the conversion name.
* It contains list of conversions to do by students.
* Then select first conversion to do.
* Now select second conversion to do.
* If first complete it goes to second other wise not getting second conversion.
* After completion it shows conversions are completed.
## Requirements
* It requires conversion name
* list of the conversion we implement.
## Features
* It gives basic idea about the number conversions.
* Student capable to understand why this number conversions to use.
